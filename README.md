# A "Simple" Rookit

If you look at the code, you can see it is not simple but it was a fun 
experience.

# Funtionality

Right now, this rootkit can:

- Grant root privilieges to a userland process
- Hide/unhide itself

# Platforms

The rootkit was tested to work on 
Linux kernels 2.6.32-38 and 4.4.0-22

# Installation
